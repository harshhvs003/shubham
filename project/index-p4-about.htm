             <p>The MCA was the brainchild of cricket administrator and former BCCI President Sarath Maddineni

               Academy was established in 2000 as a cricket facility of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for training young cricketers who are identified as having the potential to represent the Indian cricket team.
               
  
               
               BCCI has decided to put in place a new structure on the lines of the state-of-the-art high performance centres based in Australia and England.
